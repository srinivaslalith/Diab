    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant cause of blindness among working-age adults, resulting from prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage retinal blood vessels. Early detection is vital to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes. This study introduces an automated system for detecting and grading diabetic retinopathy using retinal fundus images. The model leverages an ensemble approach combining EfficientNetV2S and DenseNet201 architectures to achieve high accuracy and robustness. These advanced deep learning models analyze retinal images to detect key DR features, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates, and classify the disease into different severity levels. By integrating the strengths of both architectures, the system enhances diagnostic precision while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed solution addresses the limitations of traditional screening methods, which rely on manual assessments by specialists, and aims to provide a scalable, accessible tool for early DR detection. This model has the potential to revolutionize diabetic retinopathy management, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and preventing blindness in diabetic patients globally.</p>
